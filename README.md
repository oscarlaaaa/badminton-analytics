# BWF Badminton Analytics Dashboard
A badminton singles dashboard that allows users to look at individual player stats, see visualized trends and data, and provide an analytic head-to-head % chance of victory against another player using various regressive models. 

## Current Features
You can search for players, and render their personal profile information + some matches of theirs (incomplete). That's pretty much it for now B)

## Motivation
I wanted to show my friend some badminton statistics from a professional player's instagram story, but the story expired before I was able to. As such, I decided to take it upon myself to make my own analytics dashboard to compile my own statistics, analyze cool data points, and make something fun to use!

- [ ] Establish linear and logistic regression models
- [ ] Establish Naive-Bayes and K-nearest-neighbours models
- [ ] Establish support-vector-machines model
