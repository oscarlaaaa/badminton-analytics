# BWF Badminton Analytics Dashboard
A badminton singles dashboard that allows users to look at individual player stats, see visualized trends and data, and provide an analytic head-to-head % chance of victory against another player using machine learning models implemented by the [Badminton Analytics Lambda](https://github.com/oscarlaaaa/badminton-analytics-predictor) (WIP).

## Current Features
You can search for players, and render their personal profile information + some matches of theirs (incomplete). That's pretty much it for now B)

## Motivation
I wanted to show my friend some badminton statistics from a professional player's instagram story, but the story expired before I was able to. As such, I decided to take it upon myself to make my own analytics dashboard to compile my own statistics, analyze cool data points, and make something fun to use!

## How to Use
Visit [here](http://analytics.badminton-api.com) to test out the project!

## Progress Roadmap
- [x] Initialize project!
- [ ] Build out the basic pages (search, player display, head-to-head comparison)
- [ ] Incorporate Redux for state management (doesn't solve any immediate issues, but good practice!)
- [ ] Stylize components
- [ ] Initialize + implement predictive lambda
- [x] Host project page on Heroku or AWS with custom URL
